Seminar 1- Learning a Probabilistic Latent Space of Object Shapes via 3D GAN

Here we study We study the problem of 3D object generation.   
The paper proposes a novel framework, namely 3D Generative Adversarial Network (3D-GAN), which generates 3D objects from a probabilistic space by leveraging recent advances in volumetric convolutional networks and generative adversarial nets.  
The benefits of our model are three-fold: first, the use of an adversarial criterion, instead of traditional heuristic criteria, enables the generator to capture object structure implicitly and to synthesize high-quality 3D objects;   
second, the generator establishes a mapping from a low-dimensional probabilistic space to the space of 3D objects, so that we can sample objects without a reference image or CAD models, and explore the 3D object manifold;  
third, the adversarial discriminator provides a powerful 3D shape descriptor which, learned without supervision,has wide applications in 3D object recognition.  
Experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-quality 3D objects, and our unsupervisedly learned features achieve impressive performance on 3D object recognition, comparable with those of supervised learning methods.

Seminar 2 - Text Classification in scientific abstracts

The classification of sentences in scientific papers into different categories has been investigated in previous works.  
Various classifiers for text classification were applied and results were obtained.  
Most of the studies target the scientific abstracts instead of the complete paper and classify the sentences into categories like Background(BKG), Objective(OBJ), Method(MET), Result(RES) and conclusion.
